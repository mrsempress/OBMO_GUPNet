# OBMO: One Bounding Box Multiple Objects for Monocular 3D Object Detection

This project is based on our paper: **OBMO: One Bounding Box Multiple Objects for Monocular 3D Object Detection** and the monocular 3D detector: **Geometry Uncertainty Projection Network for Monocular 3D Object Detection**. 

## Usage

The code will be available soon. We currently only provide two checkpoints: [val](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13u4eUhy4StwhLd9IQU56fCRzV9a7D8xN/view?usp=sharing) and [test](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13P7NkqrmTh49deMvBHNP2jjnsw85yu6F/view?usp=sharing), you can test directly with the code of [GUPNet](https://github.com/SuperMHP/GUPNet).

## Acknowlegment

This code benefits from the excellent works: [GUPNet](https://github.com/SuperMHP/GUPNet).
